# azurekeyvault Provider

This provider is mostly a direct copy of the `Azure Key Vault` related resources
from the official `azurerm` provider. The main difference is, you dont have to
specify a `subscription_id` during provider initialization, which enables you
to create Key Vault resources in multiple Key Vaults, spanning `n` Azure subscriptions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Specifying required arguments in-file or as variables.
provider "azurekeyvault" {
  tenant_id     = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  client_id     = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002"
  client_secret = var.YOUR_SECRET
}

# Using environment variables
provider "azurekeyvault" {}
```
